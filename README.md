# crossrunempmedian
Joint distribution of number of crossings and longest run with empirical medain

In statistical quality control the midline is in many cases the median in the sample itself. Then the calculations in thepackage crossrun do not apply. Thi scase is addressed here. However, the calculations som far used have high complexity and are only practically feasible up to some n less than 30.
